# COMP210_2_interace_task

I'm going to create a VR version of my comp230 group game. The player is a shark and has to eat all the fish before the time runs out to win otherwise they starve to death.

## Commercial Potential

My game would be rather like the subnautica VR game which according to steamspy sells for $24.99 so I sell HighTide VR for about $10 as it isn't as well known and doesn't have such a large fan base.

Most VR game underwater such as the Blu is exploratory with little game play. Narcosis and The Deep are horror/ exploration.
